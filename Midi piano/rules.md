1. Make a single audio context when the page loads or on first user action. Keep a reference to it.

2. Prepare a list of notes. For each item include:

   * the musical name (e.g., C, D, …),
   * the keyboard key you want to trigger it with (Z, X, …),
   * its exact frequency,
   * a flag like “active” that starts as false.
     Later, you’ll also attach a temporary “oscillator” reference to each item while it’s sounding.

3. Listen for keydown events on the whole document.

4. In keydown:

   * If the event is an auto-repeat, ignore it.
   * Read the physical key code (the form that looks like “KeyZ”, not the character).
   * Find the matching note in your list by comparing that code to your stored key letter (i.e., “Key” + letter).
   * If no match, do nothing.
   * If there is a match, set that note’s “active” flag to true.
   * Call a function that (re)computes what should be playing right now.

5. Also listen for keyup events on the document.

6. In keyup:

   * Read the same physical key code.
   * Find the matching note in your list.
   * If none, do nothing.
   * If found, set that note’s “active” flag to false.
   * Call the same function that (re)computes what should be playing.

7. Write a small helper that, given a key code, returns the matching note object from your list (or returns nothing if there’s no match).

8. Create the “playNotes” function that re-syncs audio and UI every time keys change.

9. At the start of “playNotes,” loop over every note in your list:

   * Grab the DOM element for that note (e.g., something like a key with a data attribute for the note name).
   * Add or remove an “active” CSS class based on the note’s “active” flag to update visuals.
   * If this note already has an oscillator reference from a previous play, stop that oscillator and disconnect it so it doesn’t keep sounding.

10. Still in “playNotes,” build a new list containing only the notes whose “active” flag is true.

11. If no notes are active, you’re done (everything just got stopped above).

12. If there are active notes, compute a per-note volume by taking 1 divided by the number of active notes (so chords don’t get too loud).

13. For each active note, call a function that starts that note with the per-note gain you just calculated.

14. Create a “startNote” function that receives a single note and a gain value.

15. Inside “startNote,” create a gain node from your audio context and set its gain to the value passed in.

16. Create an oscillator from your audio context.

17. Set the oscillator’s frequency to the note’s stored frequency.

18. Choose a waveform type (use a simple one like sine).

19. Connect the oscillator into the gain node, then connect the gain node to the audio context’s destination (speakers).

20. Start the oscillator immediately.

21. Store the oscillator reference back onto the note object so “playNotes” can stop and clean it up the next time keys change.
